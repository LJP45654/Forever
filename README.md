Portfolio Manager Training Project

The Portfolio Tracking Application is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage and analyze their investment holdings. It supports various investment asset types (stocks, bonds, cash), provides an intuitive user interface to add, view, and update investment information, and offers analytical features to support users in making better financial decisions. The front-end is built using React, and the back-end is implemented with Node.js.
